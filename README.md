# for running this simulator.cpp file create a folder in your system and make three file
# 1>simulator.cpp
# 2>process.txt(understand it from problem statement)
# 3>status.txt(understand it from problem statement)
# and copy the given code in simulator.cpp  and now run this cpp file using VS code or in any text editor
